Update: The modules are now being put forward as a [pull request](https://github.com/Porchetta-Industries/CrackMapExec/pull/785) to go-live on CME.

Recently I have been dabbling in some CrackMapExec(CME) module development so thought it would be good to create a post on it. For those of you who have never heard of this tool, which would probably be a rarity in the Cyber Security world, it is aptly described as: 'A swiss army knife for pentesting networks'.

It is one of the goto tools for any internal pen tests and comes with many user generated modules. These range from basic checking to see if LDAP signing is enabled, to advanced things like running Mimikatz remotely, so it covers a lot of bases.

During some recent pentests I have been wanting to impersonate 'Domain Admins' at times and I wanted to be able to quickly look up who they were. So rather than go to the trouble of starting up BloodHound or crafting a LDAP search filter I thought wouldn't it be great if CME could do it.

It has modules for returning the users and groups but not for informing us of what users belong to what groups. This is where the idea for the module named GROUP-MEM came about which is just shorthand for 'group membership'.

The thinking around my second module was that at times I like to be able to figure out what are the names and IPs of the servers in the domain. Sometimes we aren't interested in seeing a list of tens of Windows 10 workstations that CME may return, but just a limited subset for us to plan our attack around.

This is where the idea for the second module named COMP-DESC ('computer description') originated. It uses LDAP to look up all the computer objects with the 'operating system' description matching the string you provide it and returns the list of computers and their IPs. One thing to note is that if there are computer accounts in LDAP that are only objects and not 'live', no IP will be returned, so it isn't scanning the network but looking up objects.

### GROUP-MEM and COMP-DESC

To run them is very easy:

**GROUP-MEM Module: Returning Domain Admins**

{% highlight powershell %}
crackmapexec ldap $DC-IP -u Username -p Password -M GROUP-MEM -o GROUP="domain admins"
{% endhighlight %}

**GROUP-MEM Module:  Returning Domain Controllers**

{% highlight powershell %}
crackmapexec ldap $DC-IP -u Username -p Password -M GROUP-MEM -o GROUP="domain controllers"
{% endhighlight %}

**COMP-DESC Module: Returning Computers with 'server' in their description**

{% highlight powershell %}
crackmapexec ldap $DC-IP -u Username -p Password -M COMP-DESC -o DESC="server"
{% endhighlight %}


**Their usage is also visible via the command line**

### GROUP-MEM Results

Here are some examples of the output from the GROUP-MEM module shown below:

**Returning Domain Computers**

This example illustrates specifying an incorrect group name 'Computers' and the subsequent error handling in place to manage this.

Then it shows the output of when a correct 'Computers' group named 'Domain Computers' is specified.

Here you can also easily verify if any **RBCD** machines such as the EVILPC shown below was successfully added or not during your testing.

**Returning Domain Controllers and Domain Admins**

### COMP-DESC Results

Here are some examples of the output from the COMP-DESC module shown below:

**Returning Servers matching the supplied description**

This example displays 2 scenarios, returning a 'Computer' object described with the word 'server' and also with the text '10'.
If the IP can be retrieved it will also do so.

**Returning a failed server lookup which illustrates its error handling**

This example shows a scenario of a 'Computer' object described with the word 'z' which is unable to be found.

### Final Thoughts

It's been really fun learning Python over the past few weeks especially with the culmination of producing some handy tools. I have successfully used these on a Pentest recently and I did feel they were quite useful so feel free to download them and try them out. You just need to place them in your ~/.cme/modules folder to use. Enjoy!
