Here is my first post on my Pen Testing Cyber Security journey. 
Just to provide some background I've worked in the ICS world about 15 years ago as a PLC programmer for 2 years so whilst Pen Testing it would be great to spend some time testing ICS Cyber Security also.

Whilst in that role I programmed Allen Bradley systems using RS Logix to control a fuel pipeline into a major UK airport. 

After 15 years in Investment Banking I've now started studying for the [OSCP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_Security_Certified_Professional) to improve my Cyber Security skills. 

This blog to begin with will just contain anything I find online that is of interest in this domain and hopefully eventually contain stories of my pen testing escapades. 

Happy to have you onboard!
