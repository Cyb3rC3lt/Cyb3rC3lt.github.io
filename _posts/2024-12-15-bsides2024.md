I had a fantastic time presenting the opening talk on the main stage at BSides London 2024 yesterday. I got a chance to explain some interesting new attack vectors using trusted binaries such as ssh, sshd and cloudflared. 

I will place the slides and video here for now and I will post a detailed blog post on this topic in the new year.
