I had a fantastic time presenting the opening talk on the main stage at BSides London 2024 yesterday. I got a chance to explain some interesting new attack vectors using trusted binaries such as ssh, sshd and cloudflared. I will place the slides here for now and I will post the video when it comes out next year including a detailed blog post on this topic.
